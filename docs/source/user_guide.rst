| through `CONTRIBUTING.MD <https://github.com/Diaga/Distributed-Finder/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md>`_ to              |
| setup the program on your machine. Once you have setup the program and Python environment, run ``python main.py`` to |
| start the `multi-directory hierarchy` Distributed Finder.                                                            |
|                                                                                                                      |
| You will be greeted with the **Finder** terminal. The terminal aims to emulate the full *Linux* or *macOS* terminal. |
| Most of the common commands like ``ls``, ``mkdir``, ``touch`` etc. will work with Finder's terminal. Browse through  |
| the commands below to see what's available!                                                                          |
